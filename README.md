2 core objects underlie the majority of the design: Containers and Components.

### Container:
> Hold Components

> Have methods related to moving Components in/out, filtering by Component type, setting maximum component count, etc.

### Component:
> Are things/do things

> Example Components include Tokens, Cards, Players, etc.

### ContainerContainer:
> Container specializing in holding other containers (useful for things like tableaus, game boards, etc.)
